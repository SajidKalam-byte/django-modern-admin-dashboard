# Publishing to PyPI - Complete Guide

Your package is now ready to be published to PyPI! Your files have been built successfully and passed all checks.

## Built Files
âœ… `dist/django_modern_admin_dashboard-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl`
âœ… `dist/django_modern_admin_dashboard-0.1.0.tar.gz`

## Option 1: Manual Publishing (Quick Start)

### Step 1: Create PyPI Account
1. Go to [https://pypi.org/account/register/](https://pypi.org/account/register/)
2. Create an account and verify your email

### Step 2: Create API Token
1. Go to [https://pypi.org/manage/account/](https://pypi.org/manage/account/)
2. Scroll down to "API tokens"
3. Click "Add API token"
4. Enter a token name (e.g., "django-modern-admin-dashboard")
5. Scope: "Entire account" (or specific project if you prefer)
6. **Copy the token immediately** (it won't be shown again!)

### Step 3: Upload to PyPI
Run this command in your terminal:

```powershell
# Upload to PyPI (production)
twine upload dist/*
```

When prompted:
- Username: `__token__`
- Password: `paste_your_api_token_here`

## Option 2: Test First on TestPyPI (Recommended)

### Step 1: Create TestPyPI Account
1. Go to [https://test.pypi.org/account/register/](https://test.pypi.org/account/register/)
2. Create an account (separate from main PyPI)

### Step 2: Upload to TestPyPI First
```powershell
# Upload to TestPyPI (testing)
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
```

### Step 3: Test Installation from TestPyPI
```powershell
# Test install from TestPyPI
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ django-modern-admin-dashboard
```

### Step 4: If Everything Works, Upload to Real PyPI
```powershell
# Upload to real PyPI
twine upload dist/*
```

## After Publishing

Once published, users can install your package with:
```bash
pip install django-modern-admin-dashboard
```

## Package Information
- **Package Name**: `django-modern-admin-dashboard`
- **Version**: `0.1.0`
- **GitHub**: [https://github.com/SajidKalam-byte/django-modern-admin-dashboard](https://github.com/SajidKalam-byte/django-modern-admin-dashboard)

## GitHub Actions (Automated Publishing)

Your package already has GitHub Actions configured. To enable automated publishing:

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Go to Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions
3. Add a new repository secret:
   - Name: `PYPI_API_TOKEN`
   - Value: Your PyPI API token
4. Now every time you create a release on GitHub, it will automatically publish to PyPI!

## Version Updates

To update your package:
1. Update version in `dashboard/_version.py`
2. Rebuild: `python -m build`
3. Upload: `twine upload dist/*`

## Troubleshooting

### "File already exists" error
- You can't upload the same version twice
- Update the version number in `dashboard/_version.py`
- Rebuild and upload again

### Authentication issues
- Make sure username is exactly `__token__`
- API token should start with `pypi-`
- Copy the entire token including the prefix
